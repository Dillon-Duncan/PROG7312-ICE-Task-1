## Convict Management Console Application

### Overview
The Convict Management Console Application is a simple C# application designed to demonstrate the usage of indexers and property accessors in object-oriented programming. It showcases how to interact with objects using both index-based and attribute name-based accessors, providing a practical example of accessing and modifying object properties dynamically.

### Features
-Dynamic Property Access: Utilize indexers to access and modify properties of a Convict object by index or attribute name.
-Interactive Console Interface: Engage with the application through a straightforward console interface, displaying and updating convict information.

### Getting Started
To run the Convict Management Console Application, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the application using your preferred IDE.

## Usage
Upon launching the application, you will be presented with a series of console outputs displaying the initial properties of a Convict object. The application then demonstrates modifying a property using an indexer and displays the updated properties using attribute names.
